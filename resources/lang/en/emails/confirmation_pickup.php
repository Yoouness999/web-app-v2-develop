<h2>Hey {user.first_name},</h2>

<p>You&#39;re all set for a dropoff and pickup on {pickup_date} at {pickup_address}</p>

{pickup_items_to_drop_off}

{pickup_items_to_pickup}

<p>We&rsquo;ll text you 15 minutes before we arrive. Once you get your storage containers, we&rsquo;ll wait up to 20 minutes while you pack.</p>

<p>You may still have some questions, so here&#39;s a short FAQ:</p>

<p><strong>Can I store fragile items ? </strong>Fragile items are great. But they break. So, we can&rsquo;t take them. Check out our&nbsp;storage rules&nbsp;for other things we don&rsquo;t store.</p>

<p><strong>How much stuff fits in a Boxify bin ? </strong>12 pairs of shoes, or 30 shirts and 10 sweaters.</p>

<p><strong>Can I store an item that doesn&rsquo;t fit in a Boxify bin ? </strong>Yep. We store bikes, AC units, luggage, skis, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I change, cancel, or reschedule my appointment ? </strong>Here. If you&rsquo;re rescheduling or cancelling, do it before 5PM on the day before your appointment.</p>

<p><strong>What happens if I don&rsquo;t show up ? </strong>We&rsquo;ll wait up to 20 minutes while trying to get in touch with you. If you&rsquo;re a no-show, we&rsquo;ll think you stood us up. :( And we&rsquo;ll have to charge you a &euro;25 no-show fee. We don&rsquo;t like doing this, so please don&rsquo;t stand us up. :)</p>

<p><strong>Do you have an Smartphone app ? </strong>Not yet&nbsp;! But our website is mobile friendly so don&rsquo;t hesitate to manage your stuff from your smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>I have more questions. </strong>Here&rsquo;s&nbsp;the longer FAQ. If that doesn&rsquo;t answer them, hit us up. Reply to this email or call us at&nbsp;&lsquo;futur num&eacute;ro de contact&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Happy upload,</p>
