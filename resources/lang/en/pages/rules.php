<h4>Our first rule : Enjoy our service.</h4>
<h4>Our second rule : In case of doubt, ask us first.</h4>
<h4>Our third rule : Pack smart.</h4>

<ul>
<li>We’ll always handle your stuff with care, but you’re responsible for packing your stuff. Please pack your items carefully so that they’re not damaged during transportation or in storage. We recommend padding your items and the inside of our bins or boxes with packing materials such as bubble wrap and packing paper.</li>
<li>If you’re storing a larger item, please pack it in a box, wrap and pad any delicate or sharp items, coil electric cords, and tape moving pieces in place. If you’re storing an AC unit (please remove it from your window before we pick it up) or mini fridge, be sure to unplug it at least 24 hours before your pickup and let it drain and air out completely. As a heads-up, we‘re not responsible for any damage to larger items that we deem to have not been properly packed, wrapped, or otherwise prepared for storage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Our fourth rule : Nothing fragile.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Please don’t store fragile items in Boxify. Aside from the express cap on our liability per box, we disclaim all liability for items that Boxify would reasonably call "fragile" such as glassware, artwork, jewelry, and electronics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Our fifth rule : Don’t store anything that’s illegal and/or unsafe.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The safety of our employees, our customers, and all of their belongings always comes first. The following items are banned from being stored in Boxify :</li>
<ul>
<li>Anything that goes boom, such as guns (or weapons of any kind), explosives, fireworks, and other flammables like gas, oil, kerosene, paint, and lighter fluid.
<li>Anything that is or was alive. This includes things like fruit, meats, cheeses, animals, insects, fungal or bacterial cultures, etc.
<li>Anything that’s illegal, such as drugs, drug paraphernalia, stolen property, and anything else that you can get arrested for possessing.
<li>Anything that smells, oozes, leaks, or bursts, such as hazardous items, toxic materials, items that produce gas or odors, any container with liquids, items that produce loud or disruptive noises, and items that may increase in size or burst. Basically, anything that might get outside of your box or bin and harm others, our customers and employees belongings, or our storage facility.
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Our sixth rule : Pay your bills.</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you have questions about a bill please contact our customer support team at <a href="/page/contact?subject=customer">support@boxify.be</a>. They’re ready to help you every day from 8 AM to 8 PM.</li>
<li>Make sure that your credit or debit card information in your Boxify account is always up to date. If your card is expired, please update your account with your new card’s information as soon as possible to prevent your account balance from going past due.</li>
</ul>
