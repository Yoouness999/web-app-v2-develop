Transporting things to Boxify is always free, and we’ll deliver your items back to your doorstep, anywhere in Belgium, for a low fee. For details on exact pricing visit our website.

A Boxify box has a capacity of 93L, and its dimensions are 68cm length x 43cm width x 32cm height.<br /><br />

A single box can hold 12 pairs of shoes, or 30 shirts and 10 sweaters. If you need help visualizing how big a box is, check out this : <br /><br />

Still not sure what fits inside a box ? Email <a href="/page/contact?subject=customer">support@boxify.be</a> and one of our customer happiness agents will assist you.<br /><br />

If you’d like to store heavier items such as books, please spread them across several boxes to avoid exceeding the maximum weight limit (25kg per box) and being charged an overweight fee. See « What is the best way to pack a Boxify box ? » for more information.<br /><br />

Pro Tip: The average Boxify customer stores 7.3 boxes.

<ul>
<li>Distribute the weight across several boxes. Spread heavier items, such as books, across several boxes to ensure the boxes won't be under too much stress (and to keep you from being charged an overweight fee).</li>
<li>Group and then pack items together that you'll likely want back at the same time. For example, if you have a dress that you love to wear with a specific pair of heels, pack them together. Put your rain boots with your umbrella. Pack all your Christmas pieces together so you don't have to request two or three boxes back for only a few items.</li>
<li>Roll, don't fold, items like t-shirts or towels to maximize space and reduce wrinkles. Stuff socks and other small items into your shoes, sneakers, and boots to maximize box space and help these items keep their shape.</li>
</ul>
If you pack your stuff in our boxes, which can be made available to you upon request, your stuff is covered under our €300/box protection policy. At this time, we disclaim liability for anything you store in your own storage containers or suitcases. If you’re using your own containers or suitcases, be sure to take extra care that they're packed well and sealed securely.

If you’re in Brussels and its suburbs (depending on your zip code), then yes of course ! We can store bicycles, golf clubs, luggage, snowboard, tires and other large items.

If you’re outside, then not at the moment. But stay tuned, this will likely change soon.
